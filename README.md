Sleep Data Analysis
This project aims to analyze sleep data using Python and its libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn.

Data Source
The sleep data used in this project is stored in two CSV files: sleep_data.csv and sleep_data_new.csv.

Data Preprocessing

The first step in the analysis is to read in the sleep_data.csv file and perform some basic data preprocessing tasks such as:
•	Print some summary statistics about the data like head, tail, shape, columns, duplicated values, null values, info, describe, and unique values.
•	Convert the 'date' column to a datetime object.
•	Create some plots like lineplot, scatterplot, histplot, distplot, boxplot, and violinplot of the sleep data using Seaborn.

The second step is to set the 'date' column as the index and read in the new sleep data from the sleep_data_new.csv file. Some basic data preprocessing tasks performed on this data are:
•	Print some summary statistics about the new data like head, tail, shape, columns, duplicated values, null values, info, and unique values.
•	Create some plots like countplot and pie chart of the new sleep data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Modeling

The final step in the analysis is to create a model to forecast sleep hours. This is done using the Autoregression (AR) model from the Statsmodels library. The model is trained on the sleep_data.csv file and used to forecast sleep hours for the next few days.

Conclusion

This project provides a basic understanding of how to perform sleep data analysis using Python and its libraries. The analysis provides insights into sleep patterns and trends that can be used to improve sleep quality.
